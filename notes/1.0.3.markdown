Bug fixes! Slight modifications! POINT RELEASE!

* Fixed some issues with the [implicit.ly](http://implicit.ly) plumbing.
* Tweaked the sample size for `Timer`, giving it 99.9% confidence level with a
  %5 margin of error (for a normally distributed variable, which it almost
  certainly isn't.)
* `Sample#iterator` returns only the recorded data, not a bunch of zeros.
* Moved units of `Timer`, `Meter`, and `LoadMeter` to their own attributes,
  which allows for easy export of Metrics data via JMX to things like
  [Ganglia](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/) or whatever.

Enjoy!
